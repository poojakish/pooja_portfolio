        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          This project focuses on discriminating normal and pathological voices in children by using machine learning techniques. Voices of children speaking Tamil phrases were recorded and analyzed using acoustic features such as pitch, shimmer, jitter, signal energy, and formant frequencies. These features were used to classify the voices using three models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), and Regression Tree.

        <h2>System Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The process involved:
          <ul>
            <li>Recording Tamil speech in a noise-free environment</li>
            <li>Removing silence using Mahalanobis distance</li>
            <li>Extracting features (pitch, shimmer, jitter, energy, formants)</li>
            <li>Classifying data using ANN, RBFNN, and Regression Tree</li>
          </ul>
          Among these, the ANN model achieved the highest accuracy of 100%, outperforming RBFNN (90%) and Regression Tree (92.4%).
